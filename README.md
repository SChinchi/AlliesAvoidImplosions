# AlliesAvoidImplosions

No more losing your hard-earned minion army to a void seed/invasion. Only the host needs this mod.

By default it only affects minions acquired from interactables, including Devoted Lemurians.

Provides settings for:
- Adding/blacklisting entities (Carbonizer Turret included, Emergency Drone excluded)
- Making your minions immune to void death because they are still not intelligent enough for your standards
  - Separate included/excluded entity list so the two behaviours can be fine-tuned independently
